# PrototypePattern

The Prototype design pattern dictates the type of objects to create by using a prototypical instance. It creates new objects by copying this prototype. This essentially means cloning the same object, which is useful in cases where performance optimization is necessary. If the creation of a new object is complex or requires significant resources, and a suitable object exists for the prototype, it is beneficial to simply copy it to optimize performance and conserve resources.
